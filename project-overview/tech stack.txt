üìö Why NOT Supabase? (Your Question Answered)
Supabase Analysis:
Supabase offers a generous free tier and PostgreSQL hosting, but has limitations when used with Prisma ORM due to current lack of support for cross-schema foreign keys.
Why We're NOT Using Supabase:
1. Multi-Tenant Limitations
Row Level Security Issues: Supabase's RLS can conflict with Prisma's migration system
Complex Setup: Requires additional configuration for proper multi-tenancy
Migration Challenges: If you plan to solely use Prisma instead of the Supabase Data API, you need to turn it off in API Settings
2. Vendor Lock-in Risk
Proprietary Features: Many Supabase features don't translate to standard PostgreSQL
Migration Difficulty: Moving away from Supabase requires significant rewrites
Limited Control: Less control over database configuration
3. Better Alternatives Available
Railway + PostgreSQL: Same ease of use, better Prisma integration
More Flexibility: Standard PostgreSQL works everywhere
Better Multi-tenant Support: Purpose-built for our architecture

üèóÔ∏è Complete Tech Stack Breakdown
Frontend Framework: Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript
Why This Combination is Perfect:
Single Codebase: Frontend + API routes in one place
Built-in Multi-tenancy: Easy subdomain routing (lawfirm1.yourdomain.com)
Type Safety: TypeScript prevents bugs and speeds development
Server Components: Better performance with React Server Components
Great SEO: Server-side rendering for public pages
UI Component Library: Mantine 7.x (WINNER)
Mantine is a fully functional React UI library that has over 100 customizable components and 50 hooks. Considering its extensive array of components, compact JS bundle size and great performances, Mantine emerges as the optimal solution.
Why Mantine is Perfect for Your Law Firm SaaS:
‚úÖ Mobile-First & Professional
100+ Components: Everything from basic buttons to complex data tables
Responsive by Default: Mobile-friendly out of the box
Professional Design: Clean, modern look perfect for law firms

Alternative UI Libraries Rejected:
Ant Design: ‚ùå Limited accessibility, limited customization, and didn't provide documentation for applying custom styles
Shadcn/ui: ‚ùå Not a traditional component library, requires Tailwind expertise
Material-UI: ‚ùå MUI using emotion causes speed optimization issues regarding LCP
Chakra UI: ‚ùå CSS-in-JS performance issues
Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
Why PostgreSQL + Prisma (Not Supabase):
Row Level Security: Perfect multi-tenant isolation
Prisma Integration: Seamless ORM without conflicts
Type Safety: Auto-generated types for your schema
Migration System: Easy database changes
Industry Standard: Works everywhere
Backend Architecture: Next.js API Routes + Prisma
// Example multi-tenant API route
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const lawFirmId = getCurrentLawFirm(request);
  
  const cases = await prisma.case.findMany({
    where: { lawFirmId }
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json(cases);
}
